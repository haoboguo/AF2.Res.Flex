AlphaFold2 Predicts Residue Flexibility

This repository contains codes for analysis of the AlphaFold2 (AF2) predicted aligned error (PAE) maps, and the distance deviation (DV) maps from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. We show that AF2 accurately predict the residue flexibilities captured by MD simulations. Code of the principal component analysis of MD trajectories is also provided, together with the primary movements (PC1) of selected systems.
